# EDL Directory

This directory contains the files required to create an EDL Deployment.

Much like the bootloader directory, this is a "done once" kinda thing, as all the devices require the same partitions, have the same amount of EMMC etc. Therefore the process would remain static accross builds.

# IMPORTANT
*MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP BEFORE DEPLOYING.*

The GPT is guesswork based on my own device. 

## Deployment Process

The following steps are required into making this a full deployment:
1. Take the edl.zip file from the latest Github CI/CD build and extract the contents to this directory
!TODO

## Contents
* aboot.bin - bootloader built by the DongleDebian/bootloader process.


## Notes
* Sector size is 512 Bytes.
* If GPT is incorrect, it can be modified using gdisk (apt installable). For this situation note, guid may change in https://github.com/alistairjordan/DongleDebian/blob/main/scripts/create_boot.sh
